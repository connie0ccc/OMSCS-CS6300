## 1 Introduction

The Job Comparer system will allow the user to enter, track, and compare job offers with their current job to find the best job opportunity based on weighting options specified by the user.  The system will be deployed to an Android device.

## 2 Process Description
This section of the project plan describes the various activities that the team will carryout during the project. The activities are broken out by phase. Certain activities in each phase may overlap, in an iterative manner, throughout the project. Many of the activities make reference to the terms "customer" and "system requirements". The term "customer" refers to classmate George P. Burdell who is represented by the instructional staff including the teacher assistants (TAs) and the professor. The term system requirements refers to the customer requirements as specified in:
 - Assignment writeup 
 - Discussion in Ed Discussion
 - Discussion during weekly office hours


### Inception Phase
#### Create Project Plan
Creating the project plan involves identifying the specific activities required to complete the project. This includes creating a schedule and timeline for the activities.  For this project, the schedule and timeline will coincide with the timeline set by the instruction staff in the assignment writeup. The project plan also involves identifying team members and the role each team member will fulfill in carrying out the activities of the project. 

*Entrance Criteria* - To create the project plan, the team will assess the talents of each team member. It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of each team member to strategically and efficiently assign project tasks and activities. For the project schedule, the team will adhere to the schedule as identified in the assignment writeup. 

*Exit Criteria* - This activity will yield the project plan. This activity will be complete once the project plan has been approved by the team.

#### Create Use-Case Model and Specifications
In this activity the team will identify appropriate use-cases for the application to meet system requirements. Using the system requirements as a guide, the team will identify the use-case activities the system must automate in order to address the project scope. This process ensures that the team understands the system requirements identified by the customer and in the project scope.

*Entrance Criteria* - The inputs for this activity include the system requirements and the assignment writeup. The writeup is necessary as it contains the vision for the project along with specific requirements of the system.

*Exit Criteria* - From this activity the team will deliver a use-case model and the associated use-case specifications. The activity will be complete once the team  and customer agree that all system requirements have been addressed. This activity may need to be revisited to ensure system requirements are being met.


#### Risk Assessment
Every project has risks. It is important to identify risks early and minimize the impact of said risks on the project. One such risk for this project involves the use of new technology. Working with new technology brings with it the inherent risk of technical knowledge or the lack thereof. Using new technology requires time to become proficient and knowledgeable with technology. It is important to identify and minimize risk as quickly as possible to ensure a successful project.

*Entrance Criteria* - Risks will first be identified by the team when the project begins. This will involve a brainstorming session to understand the implications of the technology being utilized on the project.

*Exit Criteria* - This activity will be completed in all phases of the project, especially during the Inception, Elaboration, and Construction phases. When a risk is identified, the team will discuss ways to minimize the impact of the risk. This activity will be complete when the project is complete.

### Elaboration Phase 
#### Analyze Problem Domain
Analyzing the problem domain involves gaining an understanding of the problem at hand. In this activity, the team is gaining a deeper understanding of the customer's needs and the system requirements. During this activity, the requirements from the customer are studied in detail and refined by the team. This involves creating an "almost complete" use-case model and use-case specifications. The term "almost complete" means that the team has a deep understanding of the requirements and can communicate them back the customer.

*Entrance Criteria* - Entrance criteria for this activity includes the system requirements from the user and the use-case model/specifications that were started in the Inception phase.

*Exit Criteria* - This activity is complete when the use-case model and specifications are completed to a level where the customer can give final approval.

#### Create Design Document
Creating a complete design document is critical to the success of the project. The design document will spell out the details of "what" the system will do and "how" the system will do it. Having the design document completed will ensure that the proposed solution will satisfy the customer expectations. The design document will contain several models and diagrams from the Rational Unified Process including a use-case model, component model, and a deployment diagram. Furthermore, a prototype of the screens for the proposed solution will be created. This will show the flow of the screens that will encompass the application.  Finally, the document will include a list of non-functional requirements of the system. These requirements specify the constraints and capabilities under which the application will operate.

*Entrance Criteria* - To create the design document, the team will combine information gleaned from system requirements and through discussions with the customer. This includes using the completed use-case model and specifications. 

*Exit Criteria* - This activity will be complete when the customer signs off on the design document, indicating that the construction of the system can begin. With this signoff, the customer is agreeing to the use-case model, component model, deployment diagram, user interface prototype, and a list of non-functional requirements. 


### Construction Phase
#### Development 
During system development, the code for the application will be written. This will involve writing the code to automate the activities identified in each use-case.  The code will include the appropriate classes from the class diagram, screens from the user interface prototype, and appropriate validation spelled out in the use-case specifications.

*Entrance Criteria* - This activity will require the design document and associated artifacts. 

*Exit Criteria* - The activity will be complete when all use-cases have been realized and the system has been tested. At this point, all system requirements identified from earlier phases, should be traceable and found within the solution developed. 


#### Testing 
The testing activity involves creating and executing test cases for the system. The test cases will verify that the system is doing what it needs to do.  Whitebox test cases will be written using JUnit test cases to perform unit testing.  These tests will involve testing the output of individual units within the system including the various classes developed. System testing will be performed using manual blackbox test cases. System testing will verify that all functional and non-functional system requirements are being met.

*Entrance Criteria* - The testing activity will involve writing test cases. To write the test cases, the QA Engineer will use the use-case specifications and non-functional system requirements from the Design Document.

*Exit Criteria* - The exit criteria for this activity are completed and documented test case results.


### Transition Phase

#### System Deployment
During system deployment, the application will be deployed to the target environment which was identified in the Design Document and the deployment diagram.

*Entrance Criteria* - The deployment activity requires a fully functional system that has been successfully tested.

*Exit Criteria* - The activity will be complete when system is deployed and running on the customer's Android device.


#### Feature Requests
Once the system is deployed and being utilized by the customer, there may be additional features that may be requested. This process will track new features requested by the customer. Provided that funding is available, additional features may be added to the system.

*Entrance Criteria* - The entrance criteria for this activity include input and ideas from the customer.

*Exit Criteria* - The activity will be complete once the team has met with the customer to find out ideas for other features.

#### Corrective Maintenance 
Once the system is in deployed, there may be issues and bugs with the software that were not found during system testing. Corrective maintenance will address these issues and maintenance fixes will be applied as appropriate.

*Entrance Criteria* - The entrance criteria for this project is communication from the customer when there are issues with the system..

*Exit Criteria* - The activity will be complete 1 week after the system is deployed to the Android system. If there are no issues, the project will be considered complete.

#### Customer Service
Having a satisfied customer is important to a successful software project. This involves technical support and being available when the need arises. A milestone for this project is that the system is being utilized and the customer has access to technical support. 

*Entrance Criteria* - The entrance criteria for this activity is being available to the customer. Is the team making an effort to provide excellent technical support and customer service? If not, why not? Input from the customer will help assess the level of customer service being provided.

*Exit Criteria* - The outcome of good technical support is a satisfied customer. The requirements for this activity will be realized when the customer is happy with the system and with the after-care support they are receiving. Customer service and technical support will be available to the customer at an hourly rate and will be assessed on a case by case basis.
