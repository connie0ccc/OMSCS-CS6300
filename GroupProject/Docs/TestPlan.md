# Test Plan

**Author**: Lingjie Wang

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

* Unit Testing and Integration Testing: We will create automated tests to test functions in the SystemMgr Class, which is also associated with the Job Class and ComprisonSettings Class. Who will perform: Lingjie Wang, Vince Iglehart.
* System Testing: We will perform manual tests created based on our Use Case Diagram to test if functions are producing the right value given a specific input. Who will perform: Lingjie Wang, Yanmei Li.
* Regression testing: We will re-run unit testing and integration testing to confirm that any code change will not affect unrelated existing features or other parts of the system. Who will perform: Lingjie Wang, Joshua Cochrane.

### 1.2 Test Selection

* Unit testing and Integration testing: White-box testing, Code Coverage analysis (MC/DC).
* System testing: Black-box testing, Category Partition Method.
* Regression testing: Same tests as above.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

* Unit testing and Integration testing: will use coverage criteria, MC/DC coverage (modified condition/decision coverage).
* System testing and Regression testing: will check the number of test cases that will be generated with the current categories, choices and constraints.
* Regression testing: Same tests as above.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

We will log and track all bugs detected and enhancement requests on GitHub. The information to be recorded include time reported, severity, progress (reported/assigned/in progress/closed/reopened), bug/enhancement request details, person who reported it and person worked on/fixed it.

### 1.5 Technology

We intend to use JUnit regression testing and system testing. We will be using the Issues tracking feature inside of GitHub.
