## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to assess and record the successes, challenges, and lessons learned of the project. 


## Project Completion
The Inception, Elaboration, and Construction phases are complete. The team is currently working on the final tasks for the Transition phase. The team worked well together at analyzing and understanding the user requirements. The team did a great job at testing the application using a mix of manual testing and automated testing with J-Unit tests. The customer has performed user acceptance testing and the system is ready for production.


## Product Use
The JobCompare6300 product is scheduled to be deployed to production on March 13. At that point, the customer will begin using the app to search for a job. Success of this app might involve selling this app to other potential customers on the Google Play Store.


## Lessons Learned
### Managing Risk 
The team did a good job at managing risk on the project. One area of risk was in utilizing new technology. The learning curve was substantial for working with Android Studio and building Android applications. The team divided portions of the project in order to manage the learning curve and managing the unknowns aspects of new technology. When a team member ran into roadblocks, the other members of the team stepped up to help out. One such roadblock was getting the Job Ranking screen to work with checkboxes. Many of the tutorials found on the Internet were not working for our project. In having multiple people work on this issue, the risk was addressed and the problem was solved.

### GitHub
Utilizing GitHub to manage source code and track issues was beneficial to the overall success of the project. The tool streamlined these processes on the team, allowing for smooth collaboration between team members. GitHub is an excellent tool for software development projects.

### Proper Planning
Taking the time to do up-front planning and analysis made the later phases of the project much easier. The Use-Case Specs were used during development and creating the Test Plan. The Class Diagram was helpful during the Construction phase to develop Java objects. The Class Diagram was also helpful in understanding how we should setup our database structure.
